Forked!\
\
10 roads diverged in a yellowed wood,\
But sorry, I could not travel both\
Long I stood\
And looked down 1 so far I could\
see where it forked through overgrowth;\
\
Then took the other, just as good,\
And having perhaps the better claim,\
Because it was grassy...and jesus would-\
Though as for that passing 'should'\
Both seemed morally the same,\
\
And both that evening equally lay\
In leaves my steps had yet to churn...\
But I kept the first for another day.\
Knowing my home lies along this way,\
I doubt that I'll return,\
\
but who knows?\
\
I repeat (with a sigh),\
This tale I will condense:\
10 roads diverged in a yellowed wood, and ayeâ€”\
I took the road I travelled by,\
`goto 10\
